Problems for exercises with Methods
1.	Sign of Integer
Create a method that prints the sign of an integer number.
2.	Grades
Write a method that receives a grade between 2.00 and 6.00 and prints the corresponding grade in words:
•	2.00 – 2.99 - "Fail"
•	3.00 – 3.49 - "Poor"
•	3.50 – 4.49 - "Good"
•	4.50 – 5.49 - "Very good"
•	5.50 – 6.00 - "Excellent"
3.	Printing Triangle
Create a method for printing triangles
4.	Calculations
Write a program that receives a string on the first line ("add", "multiply", "subtract", "divide") and on the next two lines receives two numbers. Create four methods (for each calculation) and invoke the right one depending on the command. The method should also print the result (it needs to be void).
5.	Orders
Write a method that calculates the total price of an order and prints it on the console. The method should receive one of the following products: coffee, water, coke, snacks, and a quantity of the product. The prices for a single piece of each product are:
•	coffee – 1.50
•	water – 1.00
•	coke – 1.40
•	snacks – 2.00
Returning Values and Overloading
6.	Calculate Rectangle Area
Create a method that calculates and returns the area of a rectangle by given width and length
7.	Repeat String
Write a method that receives a string and a repeat count n (integer). The method should return a new string (the old one repeated n times)
8.	Math Power
Create a method that calculates and returns the value of a number raised to a given power.

9.	Greater of Two Values
You are given two values of the same type as input. The values can be of type int, char of String. Create a method getMax() that returns the greater of the two values

10.	Multiply Evens by Odds
Create a program that reads an integer number and multiplies the sum of all its even digits by the sum of all its odd digits
11.	Smallest of Three Numbers
Write a method to print the smallest of three integer numbers. Use an appropriate name for the method
12.	Vowels Count
Write a method that receives a single string and prints the count of the vowels. Use an appropriate name for the method.
13.	Characters in Range
Write a method that receives two characters and prints all the characters in between them on a single line according to ASCII.
14.	Password Validator
Write a program that checks if a given password is valid. Password rules are:
•	6 – 10 characters (inclusive);
•	Consists only of letters and digits;
•	Have at least 2 digits.
If a password is valid, print "Password is valid". If it is not valid, for every unfulfilled rule, print a message:
•	"Password must be between 6 and 10 characters";
•	"Password must consist only of letters and digits";
"Password must have at least 2 digits
15.	Add and Subtract
You will receive 3 integers. Write a method sum to get the sum of the first two integers and subtract the method that subtracts the third integer from the result from the sum method
16.	Middle Characters
You will receive a single string. Write a method that prints the middle character. If the length of the string is even, there are two middle characters.
17.	NxN Matrix
Write a method that receives a single integer n and prints an nxn matrix with that number.
18.	Factorial Division
Read two integer numbers. Calculate the factorial of each number. Divide the first result by the second and print the division formatted to the second decimal point
19.	Palindrome Integers
A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward, such as 323 or 1001. Write a program that reads a positive integer number until you receive "END". For each numbered print, whether the number is palindrome or not.
20.	Top Number
Read an integer n from the console. Find all top numbers in the range [1 … n] and print them. A top number holds the following properties:
•	Its sum of digits is divisible by 8, e.g. 8, 16, 88.
•	Holds at least one odd digit, e.g. 232, 707, 87578.
